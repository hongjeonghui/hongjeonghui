### 💁 About Me

- 🤖 I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that combine **vision and language**.
- 📊 I have a strong interest in **data analysis**, **LLMs**, and **multimodal AI**.
- 🧠 I enjoy breaking down complex models and turning them into practical applications.
- 🛠️ My recent work includes projects using **YOLO**, **GPT APIs**, **EfficientNet**, and **LSTM**.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning — especially through hands-on projects and continuous debugging.
- 🎯 My goal is to create **AI-powered tools** that are useful, explainable, and even a little fun.

### 🗂️ My Projects

- 🤖 AI Interview Agent  
  A GPT-based mock interview system that automates resume analysis, strategy generation, answer evaluation, and follow-up questions.

- 🌦️ Emergency Predictor  
  A prediction model that forecasts 119 emergency call volumes using weather data and geospatial features in Korea.

- 👩‍🍳 AI Chef – Image-Based Recipe Recommendation  
  A multimodal AI project that detects ingredients from food images using YOLO and recommends recipes via GPT.  
  - 🥬 Trained on 1,900 images across 38 ingredient types  
  - 🧠 Model: YOLOv11, mAP ≈ 0.78  
  - 💡 Auto-generates recipes from detected ingredients  
  - 🔗 ChatGPT integration for interactive recipe suggestions

- 🖼️ Image Caption Generator  
  A deep learning model that generates natural language captions from input images.  
  - 📌 Trained on Flickr8k with 8,000 images and 5 captions each  
  - 🧠 Uses EfficientNetV2S for feature extraction and LSTM for captioning  
  - ⚙️ Built using Keras Functional API with custom sequence handling  
  - 🚧 Debugged input mismatch, masking, and merging issues through trial & error  
  - ✨ Evaluated using BLEU Score — improved structure and contextual understanding  
  - 🎯 Applied Dropout, EarlyStopping, tokenizer tuning for more fluent output

### ✨ Fun Facts

- 🧠 “Why isn’t this working?” is basically how I start my day.
- 📚 When I learn something, I *want* to document it. Some days I obsess over neat organization (but not every day 😅).
